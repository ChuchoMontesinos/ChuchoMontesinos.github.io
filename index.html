        <!-- Description -->
        <p align="justify"> I am a <code>Python</code> and <code>Wolfram Language</code> developer (4+ years) in the <i>Artificial Intelligence - Natural Language Processing</i> field, also I am a <i>Wolfram Student Ambassador</i>. I studied physics and mathematics, and my passion for science led me to present at the Quantum Information Division (diCu) and write a blog about LaTeX where I have a featured article as an expert contributor. Realizing the importance of communicating ideas, I participated in the Energy Transition Ideathon organized by MIT's Norman B. Leventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism (LCAU) in Mexico City. I did my community service at the Centro de Investigación en Computación IPN (CIC-IPN) in the Natural Language Processing Laboratory, where I learned <code>PyTorch</code> to create neural networks and most of the NLP knowledge that I currently have. Since then I have been a participant in the Wolfram Technology Conference, my topics were <i>Comparison of papers of English and non-English speakers in Physics (2023)</i> and <i>An Analysis of Colloquialisms: Spanish from Mexico and Spain (2024)</i>. In 2023 I was a mentor in the <i>Wolfram Summer School</i> in Boston, Massachusetts giving ideas and supporting the students with their projects. In 2024 with some mates founded the NKS Bookclub where we talked about math, physics, and cellular automata and started to publish some posts on the Wolfram Community page. Currently, I am working in an AI team creating NLP-related products and working on my bachelor's thesis about Quantum Natural Language Processing. Also, I am diving more into the NLP and Deep Learning world as a self-student to improve my understanding</p>
